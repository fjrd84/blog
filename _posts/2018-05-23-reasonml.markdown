# ReasonML Programming Language

## What is ReasonML?

ReasonML is an object-functional programming language created at Facebook. You can find more details on [What is ReasonML?](http://2ality.com/2017/11/about-reasonml.html).

## What I like and dislike so far

I like:

- Inferred types
- Code suggestions underneath the command line
- Compatibility with JS and OCaml
- Lexical scoping
- `If` is an expression that can be evaluated into a value (in other languages it is only an statement)
- Syntax of switch expressions

I dislike:

- Shadowing is allowed (let variables can be redefined)
- Operator ++ for concatenating strings
- Underscores

## Examples

```reason

let foo = {
  let a = 40;
  let b = 1;
  a + b + 1;
}; // this will bind 42 to the name `foo`

let isMorning = true;
// This binds "Good Morning" to the name `greeting`
let greeting = if (isMorning) {"Good Morning"} else {"Hello"};

// A switch expression
let greeting = stranger =>
  switch (stranger) {
    | Teacher => "Hey professor"
    | Director => "Hello director"
    | Student("Richard") => "Still here Ricky?"
    | Student(anyOtherName) => "Hey, " ++ anyOtherName ++ "."
  };

```
