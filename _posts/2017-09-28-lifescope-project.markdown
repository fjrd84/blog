# Artificial intelligence software looking for solutions to healthcare problems

## Some history

At some point in March 2017, my friend [Juan Fern√°ndez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juanff/) proposed me to join him in the development of a software he's been working on. It was a Python script, that used [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) to analyze messages coming from a twitter stream.

The idea was to use the Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine of spaCy to find messages in English where a solution is proposed to a healthcare problem, tagging both problem and solution and discarding irrelevant messages.

He had a first version of the script working on his computer, but he wanted to find a way to show it to the world, so he asked me to join him and turn his idea into an online web application. I thought that it was an interesting project, so I joined him and now, the first version of our software is online at [www.lifescope-project.com](https://www.lifescope-project.com).

## From local script to the cloud
