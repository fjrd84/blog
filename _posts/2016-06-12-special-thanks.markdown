# Acknowledgements
    
I have to specially thank the help of the following people:

- **Maria Kouman**, who is always supportive with me during my long hours in front of the computer, giving also great feedback and wonderful ideas.
- **Artur Beyrle** [(Lexip Design)](http://lexip-design.de), who crafted some layouts for my home page and provided me with an extraordinary feedback. 
- **Marcel Scherer**, from [netvico GmbH](http://www.netvico.com) who also helped me model the home page and gave me great advice about design.
- **Piotr Kulczycki**, who even while beta launching his amazing [Photler](http://www.photler.com) kindly took some time to try out an early beta of this page and gave me fantastic feedback. If you want to see a brilliant travel photography site, check out his [World In My Lens](http://www.worldinmylens.com/).
- **Rubén Álvarez**, from [Chisme Animal](https://chismeanimal.bandcamp.com/) who has always been for me, during many many years, a great source of ideas and inspiration, and provided me with feedback and material for building this site.

I also have to thank the following people for contributing to the open source community, because their work has been particularly helpful for me when developing this web page: [Bartek Szopka](https://github.com/impress/impress.js), [Peter McGriff](http://codepen.io/pmcgriff/pen/myKGZg), [Sebastian Tschan](https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery), [Dicson](http://codepen.io/dicson/pen/waKPgQ), [Mason Medeiros](http://codepen.io/medemas/pen/QwvgEr)
