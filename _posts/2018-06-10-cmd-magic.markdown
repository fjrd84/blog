# Command Line Magic

Last year I published [Vim Magic]({% link _posts/2017-05-28-vim-magic.markdown %}), where I gathered all the commands that I find particularly useful when using the Vim editor. I've kept updating it ever since whenever I've found new useful tricks. It's been so far helpful to me as a reference and hopefully to somebodyelse out there too. This post is the same but for the command line in Linux/Unix.

This is not intended to be a tutorial with the basics for you to learn how to use the command line. Instead, it's more like a reference for somebody that's been using the shell for some time now and wants to learn some new tricks.

## What is the Command Line?

{% highlight bash %}
{% endhighlight %}
