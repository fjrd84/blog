Welcome to my blog, amigos! My name is F. Javier R. Donado, I was born in Madrid (Spain), and I live in Stuttgart (Germany) since September 2012.

I [write software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfmrkyP81M) mostly for the web and I like to experiment with languages like Javascript, Typescript, Python, Clojure, and Java although I've used many others too. Currently I work for [Porsche Digital](https://www.porsche.com/specials/en/porsche-digital/) in Ludwigsburg.

I love functional programming, Docker, VIM, Visual Studio Code, and the clicky sound of a mechanical keyboard.

In addition to writing software, I [take pictures](https://www.flickr.com/photos/79693661@N05/) and sometimes I [make some strange noises](https://fractalfields.bandcamp.com/) with my electric guitar. For more information, [visit my website](https://www.jdonado.com).

Auf wiedersehen!
